## Pro Tips

### Before You Send:
1. **Test everything yourself first**
   - Send email to your personal email
   - Click the landing page link
   - Book a test demo on Calendly
   - Make sure confirmation email arrives

2. **Start small**
   - Send first batch of 25-50 emails
   - See what works
   - Adjust before sending more

3. **Personalize**
   - Use recipient's name in email
   - Reference their company
   - Shows you're not just spamming

### To Improve Results:
- **Best time to send**: Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-11am
- **Best subject lines**: Questions ("Quick question about...") perform well
- **Follow up**: If they click but don't book, send a follow-up 3 days later
- **A/B test**: Try different subject lines with different batches

## Next Steps After Your First Demo

1. **Capture feedback**: What questions did they ask? What objections?
2. **Update landing page**: Add testimonial if they're happy
3. **Refine pitch**: Adjust email template based on what resonates
4. **Scale up**: Once you're getting 1-2 bookings per 50 emails, send more

## Need Help?

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Calendly widget not showing on landing page"**
   - Make sure you replaced `YOUR_CALENDLY_LINK_HERE` with your actual link
   - Link should start with `https://calendly.com/`

2. **"GitHub Pages showing 404"**
   - Wait 5 minutes after enabling Pages
   - Make sure file is named exactly `index.html`

3. **"Emails going to spam"**
   - Use plain text email (not HTML)
   - Personalize subject lines
   - Send in small batches (50 at a time)
   - Warm up your email by sending to people who know you first

4. **"Not getting any bookings"**
   - Check your Mailchimp open rate - is it >15%?
   - Check click rate - is it >1%?
   - If yes to both, the issue is your landing page - make the value prop clearer
